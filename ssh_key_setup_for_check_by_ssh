# This is to get you set up to use the check_by_ssh plugin

# First you need to generate ssh keys, as another user besides root run:

ssh-keygen -t rsa

# now copy this key to a remote host using
# the remote host will have to have /home/<user>/.ssh directory
# if not log in and create it

cat .ssh/id-rsa.pub | ssh <remote-user>@<remote-host-address> 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

# now try ssh to the reomte server as usual
# you will be asked for a password, but any future sshing to the remote should happen without
# you needing to enter a pass word

# with the above in place you can now run the following check_by_ssh command

check_by_ssy -H <remote-host-address> -n lh -s c1 C '<command you want to execute on the remote machine>'

# this should execute on the remote machine without asking you for a password
