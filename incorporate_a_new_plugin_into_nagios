# Create your new plugin. Here is a simple example
# create the file /opt/nagios/libexec/check_myself with the following content

#!/bin/bash
echo "Everything is OK"
exit 0

# now make this file executable using
# chod +x /opt/nagios/libexec/check_myself

# now add the following to the /opt/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg

define command {
  command_name check_myself
  command_line $USER1$/check_myself
}

# now create a host in /opt/nagios/etc/objects/hosts if you don't already have one

define host {
	use		linux-server
	host_name	host1
	alias		Host One
	address		localhost
}

# finally associate a service with this host

define service {
	use 			generic-service
	host_name		host1
	service_description	Checking Myself
	check_command		check_myself
}

# after this restart your nagios server
